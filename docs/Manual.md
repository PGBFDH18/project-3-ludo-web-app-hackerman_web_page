```
NAME:
   Ludo - Ludo game played by 2-4 players

USAGE:
   Start new/load game, write the name and and color you want.
   Go to gameboard, Player 1 will start, roll the dice and select wich piece you want to move. When your turn is over Player 2 will be able to throw the dice and move.

VERSION:
   0.0.1

Rules:
Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die.
If die roll shows 6 you can either move a piece out of nest(start zone) or move a player already on the board.
In case of die shows 6 it's still your turn after you have moved.
A piece simply moves in a clockwise direction around the track given by the number thrown. If no piece can legally move according to the number thrown, play passes to the next player.
When a piece has circumnavigated the board, it proceeds up the home column. A piece can only be moved onto the goal zone by an exact throw.
When all four pieces are moved into the goal you have won the game.

Info:
 The game runs on a web application wich makes it possible for you to play with up to three friends on four different computers simultaneously!
